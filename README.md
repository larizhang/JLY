For the program to run properly, you need to have minimum python 3.6 for the libraries to run properly. Here are all the libraries you can install with pip:
  pymupdf https://pymupdf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
  numpy https://numpy.org/
  nltk https://www.nltk.org/ (you must run the nltk download and also download data marked "punkt" and "stopwords". More information can be found on nltk for data download)
  sklearn https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html
  networkx https://networkx.org/
  
You must also have a word vector data file from this website: https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/
Please select the Wikipedia pretrained word vector and download the glove.6B.zip. Then have the file glove.6b.100d.txt in the same directory as the program for it to run properly.
  
 You run this program from the python terminal and supply it a pdf file that contains a textbook. It will then allow you to summarize one chapter of a textbook if it is able to read the text from the file. You can choose the length of the summary and it will appear in a new file after the program is run!
